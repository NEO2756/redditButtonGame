# Naive Ethereum Button Game
Write a contract in Solidity that is similar to The Button(The Button (Reddit) on reddit (r/thebutton - the button â€¢ r/thebutton), where everyone pays a fixed amount of ether to call pressButton, and then if 3 blocks pass without someone calling pressButton, whoever pressed the button last can call claimTreasure and get everyone's deposits. Another analogy: musical chairs, but with (virtual) money! Resources
